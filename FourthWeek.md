# Battle of Neighborhoods

Without pulling my hairs out and jumping around for a new imaginary topic, I shall just stick to one of the tutor's suggestions and hence my title for the project (which is also copied from tutor's suggestion):
## "Best city and neighborhood to open an Indian restaurant in the several cities within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area"

## Description:
Just like the analysis of New York and Toronto neighborhoods first we try to collect all the cities (Zipcodes to be specific) within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro area, then gather their exact lattitude and logitude details. Use this modified dataframe to gather 
1. the number of Indian or similar cuisine restaurants in a neighborhood using Foursquare API
2. per city/neighborhood, reviews and user behavior patterns again using Foursquare API
3. in a region that has decent number of Indian cuisine restaurants, determine the following statistics
    1. is it a highly residential neighborhood or is it a fully commercial location with lot of office-goers (only if relevant data can be found)
    2. how many other cuisine's are very popular in the same area
Based on this data analysis we have to find a right neighborhood/city to open our client's new restaurant.
Given: Rents and other capital investments are not a factor for the client

## Background:
A client who does not have much of a concern with capital and finding a real estate, would like to open a restaurant with full scale Indian cuisine. The only concern of the client is where would the restaurant goers really embrace the full scale menu more so that he can confidently setup shop and just worry about receiving customers and serve them well. Obviously we should provide client with the top 3 options all of which are equally favorable for setup. Another factor to consider here is heavy competition. We may have to provide client with the no of direct competitors that are doing very good (highly rated by goers)
